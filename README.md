Tic Tac Toe in C++

This is a very small Tic Tac Toe game built in C++. There is a one step build script called setup.sh, which should handle compililing the game, then just run the executable. 

Itâ€™s my first C++ project, so I wanted to start simple while exploring games in C++. I couldnâ€™t think of a simpler game than Tic Tac Toe.

The only dependency is SDL2 because I wanted to keep things lightweight.

Though its not beautiful by any means, Iâ€™m fairly proud of the box highlighting (though less proud of how I actually implemented it ðŸ˜…) and it works exactly as intended. Itâ€™s obvious Iâ€™m no graphic designer, but itâ€™s functional!

Most importantly, it should run smoothly even on older hardware, which I really appreciate.
