Tic Tac Toe in C++

This is a very small Tic Tac Toe game built in C++. 

The only dependency is SDL2 because I wanted to keep things lightweight. You should first install SDL2 and SDL2_image using your Operating Systems Package Manager (brew, pacman, etc), then there is a one step build script called setup.sh, which should handle compililing the game (atleast for Mac and Linux systems), then just run the executable.

Use the mouse to click on where you want to place your piece, it will automatically switch to the next piece every click so sharing a mouse is required to play against someone. The game with automatically reset after 5 seconds. Use ESC to close the game.  

Itâ€™s my first C++ project, so I wanted to start simple while exploring games in C++. This mostly exists to prove that I understand C++ at atleast a basic level. 

Though its not beautiful by any means, Iâ€™m fairly proud of the box highlighting (though less proud of how I actually implemented it ðŸ˜…) and it works exactly as intended. Itâ€™s obvious Iâ€™m no graphic designer, but itâ€™s functional!

Most importantly, it should run smoothly even on older hardware, which I really appreciate.
